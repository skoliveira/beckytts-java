// Any line starting with // is ignored                //
// You MUST set the token and owner                    //

// This sets the token for the bot to log in with
// This MUST be a bot token (user tokens will not work)
// If you don't know how to get a bot token, please see the guide here:
// https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Getting-a-Bot-Token

token = BOT_TOKEN_HERE


// This sets the owner of the bot
// This needs to be the owner's ID (a 17-18 digit number)
// https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Finding-Your-User-ID

owner = 0 // OWNER ID


// This sets the prefix for the bot
// The prefix is used to control the commands
// If you use !!, the play command will be !!play
// If you do not set this, the prefix will be a mention of the bot (@Botname play)
// If you make this blank, the bot will not use a prefix

prefix = "@mention"


// If you set this, it modifies the default activity of the bot
// Set this to NONE to have no activity
// Set this to DEFAULT to use the default activity
// You can make the game "Playing X", "Listening to X", or "Watching X"
// where X is the title. If you don't include an action, it will use the
// default of "Playing"

activity = "DEFAULT"


// If you set this, it will modify the default status of bot
// Valid values: ONLINE IDLE DND INVISIBLE

status = ONLINE


// If you set this, the bot will also use this prefix in addition to
// the one provided above

altprefix = "NONE"


// If you set these, it will change the various emojis

success = "âœ…"
warning = "ðŸ’¡"
error = "ðŸš«"


// If you set this, you change the word used to view the help.
// For example, if you set the prefix to !! and the help to cmds, you would type
// !!cmds to see the help text

help = help


// If you set this, the bot will not leave a voice channel after it finishes a queue.
// Keep in mind that being connected to a voice channel uses additional bandwith,
// so this option is not recommended if bandwidth is a concern.

stayinchannel = true


// By default, the bot will DM the owner if the bot is running and a new version of the bot
// becomes available. Set this to false to disable this feature.

// These settings allow you to configure custom aliases for all commands.
// Multiple aliases may be given, separated by commas.
//
// Example 1: Giving command "play" the alias "p":
// play = [ p ]
//
// Example 2: Giving command "search" the aliases "yts" and "find":
// search = [ yts, find ]

// If you set this to true, it will enable the eval command for the bot owner. This command
// allows the bot owner to run arbitrary code from the bot's account.
//
// WARNING:
// This command can be extremely dangerous. If you don't know what you're doing, you could
// cause horrific problems on your Discord server or on whatever computer this bot is running
// on. Never run this command unless you are completely positive what you are running.
//
// DO NOT ENABLE THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS DOES OR HOW TO USE IT
// IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU TO ENABLE THIS, THERE IS AN 11/10 CHANCE THEY ARE TRYING TO SCAM YOU
